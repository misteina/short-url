SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1. Download repository, cd into the downloaded folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. Go to the `/database` folder inside the downloaded folder and import the `schema.sql` file into your existing MySQL installation.

3. In the `/database` folder set your database username and password in the `connection.js` file.

ASSUMPTIONS
-----------

1. I assumed that authentication wasn't necessary since it is only a demo.

2. I may have possibly made a mistake somewhere which I didn't notice. Nobody is above mistake so I hope I will be pardoned. :-)
